	<p>Reads data from a PLC</p>
	<p>This node was created as part of the <a href="https://st-one.io" target="_blank">ST-One</a> project</p>

	<h3>Outputs</h3>
	<dl class="message-properties">
		<dt>payload <span class="property-type">any</span></dt>
		<dd>
			The value(s) as read from the PLC
		</dd>

		<dt>topic<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
		<dd>
			The name of the variable, when the message refers to a single variable
			(that is, when mode is "Single Variable" or "All variables, one per
			message")
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>Details</h3>
	<p>
		All data is read cyclically from the PLC as configured in the <i>ethip endpoint</i>, 
		but there are three modes of making it available in a flow:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Single tag:</b> A single tag can be selected from the configured tags, and a 
			message is sent every time it changes. <code>msg.payload</code> contains the tag's 
			value and <code>msg.topic</code> has the tag's name.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>All tags, one per message:</b> Like the <i>Single tag</i> mode, but for all 
			tags configured.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>All tags:</b> In this mode, <code>msg.payload</code> contains an object with 
			all configured tags and their values. A message is sent if at least one of the 
			variables changes its value.
		</li>
	</ul>
